Several projects I made in collaboration with Autofuss.

For the projects to compile, you will have to add the 'shared-classes' directory to the src path for the compiler. Papervision3D, FLARToolKit, and GTweener are also needed.

The business-cards project has a Video folder which should contain these files: Bear.f4v, Butterfly.f4v, Lake.f4v.
